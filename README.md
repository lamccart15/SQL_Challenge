# SQL_Challenge


This task included researching employees from a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s within 6 CSV files. The following was completed: 

* Data Modeling: 
    - An ERD was created 
    - Tables were designed to hold and organize the data - including primary and foreign keys
    - The data was then imported into a SQL database for further analysis
